Now that we know, docker can be used to create, run and manage containers.

Let's see what all containers are running currently.

`clear`{{execute}}

`docker ps --help`{{execute}}

`docker ps`{{execute}}

`docker ps -a`{{execute}}

Ah, we don't have any containers. Well it makes sense because we did not create and run any. We need `image` for creating `container`.
