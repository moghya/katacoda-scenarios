## Problems:
1. But it works on my machine.
2. That libray is missing.
3. The two applications need different version of shared library.
4. This one program eats up all the main memory and the other process couldn't allcoate memory at runtime that it required.
5. Installtion and manging this application is one hell of a task.


## Requirements:
1. How to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another.
2. Resolve conflicts between programs.
3. Limiting amount of resource usage by an application.
4. Better interface for managing lifecycle of processes.
